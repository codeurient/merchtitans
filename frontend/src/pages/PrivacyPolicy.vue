                            nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The
                            law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United
                            States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable
                            Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website
                            stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom
                            it is being shared. - See more at:
